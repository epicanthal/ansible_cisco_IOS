# This playbook is based on Ansible 2.1, which is the initial version to
# include modules for networking device, of which IOS is suppoted as a set of modules.
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html
# Note: Try to stay consistent with indenting, here two-space indenting is used.

# In this playbook we'll introduce:
#   - using an invetory group
#   - issuing more than a single 'ios_command' command and then access the
#     returned data.

    # -------------------------------------------------------------
    # Using a group for the playbook.  In /etc/ansible/hosts file, I have a
    # group defined:
    #
    #   [my_switches]
    #   192.168.1.9
    #
    # To keep things simple, only a single host is listed in the group, but
    # you can add as many as you like.
  - hosts: my_switches
    # See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html for
    # formatting of the ansible 'hosts' file.
