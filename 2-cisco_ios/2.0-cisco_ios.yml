# This playbook is based on Ansible 2.1, which is the initial version to
# include modules for networking device, of which IOS is suppoted as a set of modules.
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html
# Note: Try to stay consistent with indenting, here two-space indenting is used.

# In this playbook, we'll introduce:
#   - ./group_vars and ./host_vars directories
#
# Refer to:
#   - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#splitting-out-host-and-group-specific-data
#   - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout
#
# You will notice comparing the two links above, you can either:
#   1. Place /group_vars and /host_vars relative to the inventory file,
#          e.g. /etc/ansible/hosts/[group_vars|host_vars]
#   2. Place /group_vars and /host_vars relative to the top-level playbook directory,
#          e.g. ./playbook_dir/[group_vars|host_vars]
#
# Notes:
#   - This playbook is basically the same as ./1-cisco_ios/1.0-cisco_io.yml
#     with minor changes as commented.
#   - Assumes a group [my_switches] is defined in the inventory file,
#     e.g. /etc/ansible/hosts
#   - Assumes host 192.168.1.9 is a member of [my_switches] group

    # -------------------------------------------------------------
  - hosts: 192.168.1.9
    gather_facts: no
    connection: local

    # Here the 'connect_settings' section has been moved to
    #   ./group_vars/my_switches.yml
    # to deomonstrate how variables are ingested for the group 'my_switches'
    # by simply creating a file in ./group_vars named the same as the group.
    # Notice how Ansible determines that even though I listed only the IP address
    # 192.168.1.9 under the hosts variable, the group [my_switches] variables
    # are included.
