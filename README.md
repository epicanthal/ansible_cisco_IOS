##Basic Ansible playbooks for Cisco IOS
This project is a collection of playbook examples for networking devices, specifically Cisco IOS.  I only have access to Cisco IOS and NXOS devices so I figured I'd start learning Ansible through interaction with Cisco IOS.

My goal:
- add to this repo as I learn more Ansible.
- enhance my learning by documenting the playbooks
- provide simple examples that aren't too lengthy to hopefully save you time getting started with Ansible w/networking gear.

The idea is to create sections (directories) that are somehow related, e.g. section **_1-cisco_ios_** contains simple playbooks that do not reference any of the Ansible subdirectory structure or roles.
